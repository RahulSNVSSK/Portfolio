        <h3>Data Management Hub – Analytical MDM</h3>
    <p class="muted">UK Water Utilities Client | June 2023 – Present</p>
    <div class = "Justify-text">
    <p>
        This project focuses on building an Analytical Master Data Management (MDM) solution for
        Property, Asset, and Customer master domains as part of a strategic data governance
        initiative. Data from multiple enterprise systems including Reference Data sets, AI2,
        SAP S/4HANA, ABP, GIS, SAP IS-U, and SAP ECC are integrated into the Profisee MDM platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Azure Data Factory (ADF) is used to ingest data via REST APIs, after which data quality
        validation rules are applied to ensure accuracy and consistency. Matching and survivorship
        strategies are implemented to generate reliable golden records, establishing a centralized
        single source of truth within Profisee. The mastered data is then published to Data Lake
        storage, where Power BI dashboards are built to compare inbound and outbound data quality
        metrics. This solution supports enhanced data governance, quality monitoring, and analytics
        enablement for a UK-based water utilities organization.

    <h3>Profisee MDM Integration with AWS Glue & Azure ADF – PoC</h3>
    <p class="muted">Hexaware Technologies | March 2023 – May 2023</p>
    <div class = "Justify-text">
    <p>
        This Proof of Concept (PoC) was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating
        the Profisee MDM platform with AWS Glue and Azure Data Factory. The focus was on
        streamlining data ingestion, processing, and golden record generation using cloud-native
        ETL services.
    </p>
    <p>
        REST APIs were leveraged to enable seamless communication between Profisee, AWS Glue,
        and Azure ADF. The PoC showcased efficient data movement, transformation, and master data
        consolidation, highlighting the flexibility of Profisee in hybrid cloud integration
        scenarios and supporting enterprise-scale data management use cases.

    <h3>Profisee RDM & MDM Center of Excellence (CoE) – Pre-Sales</h3>
    <p class="muted">Hexaware Technologies | November 2022 – February 2023</p>
    <div class = "Justify-text">
    <p>
        This initiative focused on building an end-to-end Reference Data Management (RDM) and
        Master Data Management (MDM) solution within the Profisee Center of Excellence to support
        pre-sales activities. The solution was designed to demonstrate the full capabilities of
        the Profisee platform to prospective clients across various industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        The implementation included configurable RDM and MDM models, governance workflows, and
        data quality rules, along with Power BI dashboard integration for visualization and
        reporting. This pre-sales solution served as a customizable demonstration framework,
        enabling clients to understand how Profisee can address their specific data governance
        and master data requirements.
